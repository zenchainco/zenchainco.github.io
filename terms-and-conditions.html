            to you for any termination of your rights under these Terms, including
            for termination of your Account. Even after your rights under these
            Terms are terminated, the following provisions of these Terms will
            remain in effect: Sections 2.2 through 2.5 and Sections 3 through 8.
          </p> <p><strong>8. GENERAL</strong></p> <p>
            Changes. These Terms are subject to occasional revision, and if we
            make any substantial changes, we may notify you by sending you an
            e-mail to the last e-mail address you provided to us (if any), and/or
            by prominently posting notice of the changes on our Sites. You are
            responsible for providing us with your most current e-mail address. In
            the event that the last e-mail address that you have provided us is
            not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you the
            notice described above, our dispatch of the e-mail containing such

            of an e-mail notice to you (if applicable) or thirty (30) calendar
            days following our posting of notice of the changes on our Sites.
            These changes will be effective immediately for new users of our
            Sites. Continued use of our Sites following notice of such changes
            shall indicate your acknowledgement of such changes and agreement to
            be bound by the terms and conditions of such changes.<br>Dispute
            Resolution. Please read this Arbitration Agreement carefully. It is
            part of your contract with Company and affects your rights. It
            contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS
            ACTION WAIVER.
          </p> <p>
            (a) Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. All claims and disputes
            (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set
            forth below) in connection with the Terms or the use of any product or
            service provided by the Company that cannot be resolved informally or
            in small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an
            individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. Unless
            otherwise agreed to, all arbitration proceedings shall be held in
            English. This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and the Company,
            and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors
            in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or
            unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided
            under the Terms.
          </p> <p>
            (b) Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution. Before either
            party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other
            party a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”) describing the nature and
            basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief. A Notice to
            the Company should be sent to: 8171 Brittany Drive, Dublin,
            California, 94568. After the Notice is received, you and the Company
            may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you and the
            Company do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days
            after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration
            proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may
            not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has
            determined the amount of the award, if any, to which either party is
            entitled.
          </p> <p>
            (c) Arbitration Rules. Arbitration shall be initiated through the
            American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), an established alternative
            dispute resolution provider (“ADR Provider”) that offers arbitration
            as set forth in this section. If AAA is not available to arbitrate,
            the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider. The
            rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration,
            including but not limited to the method of initiating and/or demanding
            arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the
            Terms. The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules (“Arbitration Rules”)
            governing the arbitration are available online at<a href="http://www.adr.org/">
              www.adr.org</a>
            or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration shall be
            conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes
            where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand
            U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding
            non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking
            relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award
            sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right
            to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any hearing
            will be held in a location within 100 miles of your residence, unless
            you reside outside of the United States, and unless the parties agree
            otherwise. If you reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator shall
            give the parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any
            oral hearings. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator
            may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. If the
            arbitrator grants you an award that is greater than the last
            settlement offer that the Company made to you prior to the initiation
            of arbitration, the Company will pay you the greater of the award or
            $2,500.00. Each party shall bear its own costs (including attorney’s
            fees) and disbursements arising out of the arbitration and shall pay
            an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.
          </p> <p>
            (d) Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration. If
            non-appearance based arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be
            conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written
            submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party
            initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any
            personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise
            agreed by the parties.
          </p> <p>
            (e) Time Limits. If you or the Company pursue arbitration, the
            arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the
            statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim)
            and within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent
            claim.
          </p> <p>
            (f) Authority of Arbitrator. If arbitration is initiated, the
            arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and
            the Company, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other
            matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator
            shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part
            of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award
            monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief
            available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and
            the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of
            decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which
            the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.
            The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual
            basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the
            arbitrator is final and binding upon you and the Company.
          </p> <p>
            (g) Waiver of Jury Trial. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR
            CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN
            FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and
            disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration
            Agreement. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more
            efficient and less costly than rules applicable in a court and are
            subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation
            should arise between you and the Company in any state or federal court
            in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU
            AND THE COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing
            that the dispute be resolved by a judge.
          </p> <p>
            (h) Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES
            WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR
            LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS
            OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED
            JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.
          </p> <p>
            (i) Confidentiality. All aspects of the arbitration proceeding,
            including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator and
            compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential. The parties
            agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law.
            This paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of
            law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an
            arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.
          </p> <p>
            (j) Severability. If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement
            are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of
            competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of
            no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the
            Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
          </p> <p>
            (k) Right to Waive. Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth
            in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom
            the claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other
            portion of this Arbitration Agreement.
          </p> <p>
            (l) Survival of Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the
            termination of your relationship with Company.
          </p> <p>
            (m) Small Claims Court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or
            the Company may bring an individual action in small claims court.
          </p> <p>
            (n) Emergency Equitable Relief. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either
            party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or federal
            court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration. A
            request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other
            rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.
          </p> <p>
            (o) Claims Not Subject to Arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
            claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act,
            and infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent,
            copyright, trademark or trade secrets shall not be subject to this
            Arbitration Agreement.
          </p> <p>
            (p) Courts. In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration
            Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby
            agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located
            within United States County, California, for such purpose
          </p> <p>
            Export. The Sites may be subject to U.S. export control laws and may
            be subject to export or import regulations in other countries. You
            agree not to export, reexport, or transfer, directly or indirectly,
            any U.S. technical data acquired from Company, or any products
            utilizing such data, in violation of the United States export laws or
            regulations.
          </p> <p>
            Disclosures. Company is located at the address in Section 8.8. If you
            are a California resident, you may report complaints to the Complaint
            Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Product of the California

            Street, Sacramento, CA 95814, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210.
          </p> <p>
            Electronic Communications. The communications between you and Company
            use electronic means, whether you use the Sites or send us emails, or
            whether Company posts notices on the Sites or communicates with you
            via email. For contractual purposes, you (a) consent to receive
            communications from Company in an electronic form; and (b) agree that
            all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other
            communications that Company provides to you electronically satisfy any
            legal requirement that such communications would satisfy if it were be
            in a hardcopy writing. The foregoing does not affect your non-waivable
            rights.<br>Entire Terms. These Terms constitute the entire agreement
            between you and us regarding the use of the Sites. Our failure to
            exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not
            operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in
            these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual
            effect. The word “including” means “including without limitation”. If
            any provision of these Terms is, for any reason, held to be invalid or
            unenforceable, the other provisions of these Terms will be unimpaired
            and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so
            that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by
            law. Your relationship to Company is that of an independent
            contractor, and neither party is an agent or partner of the other.
            These Terms, and your rights and obligations herein, may not be
            assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you
            without Company’s prior written consent, and any attempted assignment,
            subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing
            will be null and void. Company may freely assign these Terms. The
            terms and conditions set forth in these Terms shall be binding upon
            assignees.<br>Copyright/Trademark Information. Copyright © 2020
