                      operating any site or service to which the Services link.
                      The inclusion of a link on the Services does not imply
                      endorsement of the linked site or service by us or by our

                      that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable and
                      thus we cannot and do not guarantee the security of your

                      control of your credentials, and not share your passwords
                      or private keys with anyone.

                      We take measures to delete your Personal Information or
                      keep it in a form that does not permit identifying you

                      or permitted by law to keep this information for a longer
                      period. When determining the specific retention period, we
                      take into account various criteria, such as the type of
                      Services provided to you, the nature and length of our
                      relationship with you, and mandatory retention periods
