            This Privacy Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for,
            the privacy, information or other practices of any third parties, or
            any third party operating any site or service to which the Services
            link. The inclusion of a link on the Services does not imply
            endorsement of the linked site or service by us or by our affiliates.
            We encourage you to learn about third-parties’ privacy and security
            policies before providing them with information.
          </p> <p><strong>5. Security</strong></p> <p>
            We use certain physical, organizational, and technical safeguards that
            are designed to maintain the integrity and security of information
            that we collect. Please be aware that no security measures are perfect
            or impenetrable and thus we cannot and do not guarantee the security
            of your data. It is important that you maintain the security and
            control of your credentials, and not share your passwords or private
            keys with anyone.
          </p> <p><strong>6. Your Rights and Choices</strong></p> <p>
            You have several rights and choices with regard to our use of your
            Personal Information. You may, of course, decline to share certain
            Personal Information with us, in which case we may not be able to
            provide to you some of the features and functionality of the Services.
            If you wish to access, amend, or delete any other Personal Information
            we hold about you, you may contact us using the contact details at the
            end of this Policy. Please note that while any changes you make will
            be reflected in active user databases instantly or within a reasonable
            period of time, we may retain all information you submit for backups,
            archiving, prevention of fraud and abuse, analytics, satisfaction of
            legal obligations, or where we otherwise reasonably believe that we
            have a legitimate reason to do so, as permitted under applicable data
            protection law. From time to time, we send marketing email messages to
            our users. If you no longer want to receive such emails from us on a
            going forward basis, you may opt-out via the “unsubscribe” link
            provided in each such email or by contacting us using the contact
            details at the end of this Policy.
          </p> <p><strong>A. Your European Privacy Rights</strong></p> <p>
            If you are located in the European Economic Area, you have additional
            rights described below.
          </p> <ul><li>
              You may request access to and receive information about the Personal
              Information we maintain about you, update and correct inaccuracies
              in your Personal Information, restrict or object to the processing
              of your Personal Information, have the information anonymized or
              deleted, as appropriate, or exercise your right to data portability
              to easily transfer your Personal Information to another company. In
              addition, you may also have the right to lodge a complaint with a
              supervisory authority, including in your country of residence, place
              of work, or where an incident took place.
            </li> <li>
              You may withdraw any consent you previously provided to us regarding
              the processing of your Personal Information, at any time, and free
              of charge. We will apply your preferences going forward and this
              will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before you withdrew
              your consent.
            </li></ul> <p>
            You may exercise these rights by contacting us using the contact
            details at the end of this Policy. Please note that there are
            exceptions and limitations to each of these rights, and that while any
            changes you make will be reflected in active user databases instantly
            or within a reasonable period of time, we may retain information for
            backups, archiving, prevention of fraud and abuse, analytics,
            satisfaction of legal obligations, or where we otherwise reasonably
            believe that we have a legitimate reason to do so.
          </p> <p><strong>B. Your Cookie Choices</strong></p> <p>
            You have the following choices with regard to the use of cookies and
            similar technologies:
          </p> <ul><li>
              Browser settings. Many web browsers allow you to manage your
              preferences relating to cookies. You can set your browser to refuse
              cookies or delete certain cookies. You may be able to manage other
              technologies in the same way that you manage cookies using your
              browser’s preferences. Please note that if you choose to block
              cookies, doing so may impair the use of our Services.
            </li> <li>
              Do Not Track Signals. There is no accepted standard on how to
              respond to Do Not Track signals, and we do not respond to such
              signals.
            </li></ul> <p><strong>7. Use of Services by Minors</strong></p> <p>
            The Services are not directed to individuals under the age of thirteen
            (13), and we request that they not provide personal information
            through the Services. If you learn that a child under 13 has provided
            us with personal information in violation of this Privacy Policy, then
            you may alert us at contact@zenChain.co.
          </p> <p><strong>8. International Visitors</strong></p> <p>
            ZenChain Protocol uses servers hosted in the United States and is
            intended for users in the United States. If you choose to use the
            Services from regions of the world with laws governing data collection
            and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may be
            transferring your information outside of your region for storage and
            processing in the United States and around the globe. By using the
            Services you consent to the transfer of information to countries
            outside of your country of residence, including the United States,
            which may have data protection rules that are different from those of
            your country.
          </p> <p><strong>European Visitors</strong></p> <p>
            If you are located in the European Economic Area, we will comply with
            applicable EEA data protection law when transferring your Personal
            Information outside of the EEA. We may transfer your Personal
            Information to countries which have been found to provide adequate
            protection by the EU Commission (e.g., Canada), use contractual
            protections for the transfer of Personal Information, or transfer to
            recipients who have certified to the Privacy Shield or adopted Binding
            Corporate Rules. For more information about how we transfer Personal
            Information outside of the EEA, or to obtain a copy of the contractual
            safeguards we use for such transfers, you may contact us as specified
            below.
          </p> <p><strong>9. Retention</strong></p> <p>
            We take measures to delete your Personal Information or keep it in a
            form that does not permit identifying you when this information is no
            longer necessary for the purposes for which we process it, unless we
            are required or permitted by law to keep this information for a longer
            period. When determining the specific retention period, we take into
            account various criteria, such as the type of Services provided to
            you, the nature and length of our relationship with you, and mandatory
            retention periods provided by law and the relevant statute of
            limitations.
          </p> <p><strong>10. Updates to this Privacy Policy</strong></p> <p>
            We may make changes to this Privacy Policy. The “Effective Date” at
            the top of this page indicates when this Privacy Policy became
            effective. If we make material changes, we may notify you through the
            Services or by sending you an email or other communication. We
            encourage you to read this Privacy Policy periodically to stay
            up-to-date about our privacy practices. Your use of the Services
            following these changes means that you accept the revised Privacy
            Policy.
